            <h1>Public Libraries and Open Data Survey</h1>
            <p>
            <p>The Open Data Literacy (ODL) Project, in collaboration with the University of Washington (UW) and the Washington State Library, is conducting a survey about the use of open government data in public libraries in Washington.</p>
            </p>As part of <a href="https://ischool.uw.edu">UW's Information School</a>, ODL is researching how public libraries and their patrons are interacting with open government data, in hopes that the results of the survey will shed light on the current activity, interest, opportunity, and capacity for open government data in libraries across the state of Washington. Open data connects to many core library values, such as open access, information literacy, and civic engagement. As the open data movement grows, we want to better understand what role the library should play when helping citizens access open data, and we’re looking to Washington’s public libraries to find out.</p>
