            <h1>Public Libraries and Open Data Survey</h1>
            <p>
            <p>The Open Data Literacy (ODL) Project, in collaboration with the <a href="https://www.uw.edu">University of Washington (UW) and the <a href="https://www.sos.wa.gov/library/">Washington State Library, is conducting a survey about the use of open government data in public libraries in Washington.</p>
            </p>As part of <a href="https://ischool.uw.edu">UW's Information School</a>, ODL is researching how public libraries and their patrons are interacting with open government data, in hopes that the results of the survey will shed light on the current activity, interest, opportunity, and capacity for open government data in libraries across the state of Washington. Open data connects to many core library values, such as open access, information literacy, and civic engagement. As the open data movement grows, we want to better understand what role the library should play when helping citizens access open data, and we’re looking to Washington’s public libraries to find out.</p>

            <h2>What is open data?</h2>
            <p>Open data is data that can be freely used, re-used, and redistributed by anyone as publicly available resources that can be accessed, used, and shared by all. (<a href="http://opendatahandbook.org/guide/en/what-is-open-data/">Open Data Handbook</a>, n.d.)</p>
            <p>Open data promotes transparency, citizen involvement, innovation, informed decision-making, and action, to the benefit of individuals, communities, government, and business.</p>
            <h2>What is the Open Data Literacy Project?</h2>
            <p> Open Data Literacy (ODL) is focused on improving accessibility and use of open data, specifically for communities that can benefit most from public sector information. Practically, ODL advances data literacy by developing new curriculum for iSchool students and public librarians; coordinating internships, fieldwork, and action research projects between the University of Washington (UW) and public institutions with open data initiatives; and, producing community workshops and open education resources that are freely available to the general public. Because ODL believes libraries are well-positioned to promote open data literacy, much of ODL’s research centers around the role of libraries in the open data movement.

ODL is based in the Information School at UW, and supported by a three-year Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) grant. Our ongoing work includes diverse partners such as Washington State Library, Seattle Public Library, Washington State Department of Transportation, City of Seattle, and State of Washington’s Office of Innovation. We are also looking for additional partners throughout the country.</p>
            <h2>Public Libraries and Open Data<h2>
            <p>Open data connects to core library values such as open access, information literacy, and civic engagement. Plus, libraries have a long history of helping the public navigate new information resources, and librarians understand how to balance humans and technology. When taken together, the library is positioned to be as an excellent curator of open data. </p>
             <p>Libraries are stepping into various roles to support the open data movement. Some are publishing library data as open data, some are acting as consultants to their local governments on open data best practices, and others are educating the public, teaching patrons how to work with open data. To see an example of a library doing all of the above, visit the Edmonton Public Library's <a href="https://www.epl.ca/opendata">web page on open data</a>, or review this presentation on the role of libraries in open data literacy.
