In collaboration with technical and business stakeholders, I am conducting initial work for a full business analysis of WSDOT Data or Term Search (DOTS), which is managed by the Data Management Services (DMS) group. At its heart, DOTS is a data catalog: an inventory of all of the data objects within DMS-managed environments, along with technical metadata for those objects. The analysis, once complete, will help data and domain experts deliver greater benefit to knowledge seekers through improvements to DOTS and related information-sharing processes.
