Interoperability, dispersed data, and inconsistent data formats are common issues across information science. This Open Data Literacy (ODL) Capstone tackles these issues in the realm of environmental restoration. Numerous restoration projects have been undertaken throughout the Puget Sound, but connecting investments in these projects to co-located indicators of habitat viability is challenging. Our team leveraged open, found data and open-source tools to build a scalable, sustainable data processing pipeline and an interactive, web-based visualization prototype. This helps our partners better tell the story of Puget Sound restoration efforts and demonstrates that open-source tools can help data curators meet open-data needs.
