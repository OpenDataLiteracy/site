####TROUT
On a conceptual level, we are delving in to the information problem of opening up scientific data to the public in way that can be easily understood. Specific to our partnership with WDFW, the department has a large collection of land cover data with the potential to tell the story of change over time (due to development and forestry) and the impact of the WDFW's restoration, protection and conservation efforts. Despite it's potential, this data has thus far lacked visibility to the public.

####Description
The Total Resource Observation Utility Team (TROUT), created a data visualization using Washington Department of Fish & Wildlife’s (WDFW) high-resolution land change data. The interactive visualization makes this important data understandable to the public, policymakers, and environmental scientists. TROUT has unlocked this public data and improved access by disseminating in a clear, concise, user-centered dashboard presenting actionable information. This visualization allows the user to see actual changes in the Puget Sound over time with data-rich GIS information describing the changes. TROUT’s use of open-source technologies and code documentation mean the dashboard can be replicated for displaying future public spatial datasets.
