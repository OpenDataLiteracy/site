The Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) is moving its data to a new platform and Angela was tasked with helping to define techniques to identify and proactively release data and documents commonly requested through the Public Disclosure Request process. Her primary goal was to create a ranked list of the most frequently requested types of datasets and records, and then assess the types of exemptions associated with that type of request.  She would then find the least restricted datasets and records for open disclosure.
