My role within the Geospatial Program Office is to evaluate and consolidate Washington Stateâ€™s three main geoportals into one. Multiple authoritative portals are expensive, inefficient, and confusing for new users. Transitioning requires indexing geospatial and non-geospatial data from disparate portals, tracking departmental provenance, and constructing a sustainable portal that can be easily utilized by stakeholders with varying abilities. To that end, I am reviewing literature on current geoportal best practices and drafting a eight-week plan for completion. The new, singular geoportal should be up and running by the end of the summer.
