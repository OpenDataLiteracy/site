Leslie gathered insights about public record request trends using request logs and interviews. She summarized the concerns about the open data/public records relationship and presented possible insights/recommendations including a plan to create an Open Data Alliance. For her deliverable she created an Open Data Alliance Guidebook to support and formalize a coalition of professionals concerned with Open Data projects with a specific focus on Public Records Requests as a commonality across jurisdictions.
