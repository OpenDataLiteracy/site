Kathleen conducted an environmental scan at the Washington State Library exploring two little-researched topics: the extent of open data published by local government, and public libraries’ roles in open data publishing and instruction. Based on her interviews, Kathleen recommended that the State Library add a central open data resource guide to the “Library Services” section of its website, and explore options for providing a statewide platform for local open data publishing. Kathleen’s work was so valuable to the Washington State Library that they extended her a temporary contract to continue her work.
