            <p>Open Data Literacy is a three-year IMLS grant funded project focused on improving accessibility and use of open data - focused specifically on communities that can benefit most from public sector information. Practically, ODL will advance data literacy by developing new curriculum for iSchool students and public librarians; coordinating internships, fieldwork, and action research projects between UW and public institutions with open data initiatives, and; producing community workshops and open education resources that are freely available to the general public.</p>

            <p>Our ongoing work includes diverse partners such as the Washington State Department of Transportation, the Seattle Public Library, the City of Seattle, and State of Washingtonâ€™s Office of Innovation. We are also looking for additional partners throughout the country.</p>
