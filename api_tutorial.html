            <h1> Tutorial: Introduction to APIs for Open Government Data</h1>
            <p>
            <h4> Authored by: An Yan & Bree Norlander</h4>
            <p>Collecting data is essential for data curators. In order to learn how to collect data, this tutorial introduces users to the concept of an API. Users will learn examples of and practical guidelines for accessing data and metadata from public sources using APIs. Specifically, this tutorial first teaches users how to work with SODA API, which is provided by an Open Government Data (OGD) Portal provider, <a href="https://socrata.com">Socrata</a>. Once the tutorial is complete, users will know how to retrieve open government datasets and their metadata through the <a href="https://dev.socrata.com/consumers/getting-started.html">SODA API</a>, <a href="https://socratadiscovery.docs.apiary.io/#">Discovery API</a>, and <a href="https://socratametadataapi.docs.apiary.io/#">Metadata API</a>.

            <p>Open Data Literacy is a three-year IMLS grant funded project focused on improving accessibility and use of open data - focused specifically on communities that can benefit most from public sector information. Practically, ODL will advance data literacy by developing new curriculum for iSchool students and public librarians; coordinating internships, fieldwork, and action research projects between UW and public institutions with open data initiatives, and; producing community workshops and open education resources that are freely available to the general public.</p>
            <h2 id="secondheading">testing toc</h2>
            <p>Our ongoing work includes diverse partners such as the Washington State Department of Transportation, the Seattle Public Library, the City of Seattle, and State of Washingtonâ€™s Office of Innovation. We are also looking for additional partners throughout the country.</p>
            <h3 id="thirdheading">Is this TOC working?</h3>
