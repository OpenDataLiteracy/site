            <p>Open Data Literacy is a three-year IMLS grant funded project focused on improving accessibility and use of open data - focused specifically on communities that can benefit most from public sector information. Practically, ODL will advance data literacy by developing new curriculum for iSchool students and public librarians; coordinating internships, fieldwork, and action research projects between UW and public institutions with open data initiatives, and; producing community workshops and open education resources that are freely available to the general public.</p>

            <p>Our ongoing work includes diverse partners such as the Washington State Department of Transportation, the Seattle Public Library, the City of Seattle, and State of Washington’s Office of Innovation. We are also looking for additional partners throughout the country.</p>
