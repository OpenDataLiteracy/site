            <h2 id="topheader"> Tutorial: Using OpenRefine to work with metadata in civic data portals</h2>
            <p>
            <b> Authored by: An Yan</b>
            <p>As a data curator, we constantly need to deal with messy data and metadata. <a href="http://openrefine.org" target="_blank">OpenRefine</a> is a popular open-source tool for cleaning and transforming data. This tutorial will show you how to use OpenRefine to clean metadata about Open Civic Portals pulled from <a href="https://socrata.com" target="_blank">Socrata</a>, an Open Government Data (OGD) Portal provider. We will first use <a href="https://socratadiscovery.docs.apiary.io" target="_blank">Discovery API</a> provided by Socrata to get metadata. Then we will learn to use OpenRefine to perform format transformation, duplicates checking, columns splitting, and exploratory analysis.
            <p>To learn more about APIs, go through the <a href="http://odl.ischool.uw.edu/api_tutorial/" target="_blank">API tutorial</a>.     
            <p>
            <h3 id="nextheaderone"> Learning Objectives </h3>
            <p> <ul> 
            <li>Use API to collect data from public data sources such as open government data portals.</li>
            <li>Use OpenRefine to do data cleaning.</li></ul>
            <h3 id="nextheadertwo"> Prerequisites </h3>
            <p> <ul> 
            <li>Computer and internet access
            <li>Basic understanding of open data and data repositories; knowledge of popular open data portal software providers (<a href="https://ckan.org" target="_blank">CKAN</a>, <a href="https://socrata.com" target="_blank">Socrata</a>, <a href="https://dataverse.org" target="_blank">Dataverse</a>, etc.)</li>
            <li>Familiarity with common web exchange file formats, such as JSON, XML, and CSV.</li>
            <li>Basic knowledge of API. (View our <a href="http://odl.ischool.uw.edu/api_tutorial/" target="_blank">API tutorial</a>.</li></ul>
			
			
            <h2 id="myHeader">Introduction to OpenRefine</h2>
            <p>OpenRefine is similar Google spreadsheet in some sense. They both handle tabular data in a browser and allow sharing among different users. However, OpenRefine can deal with many data formats that are frequently used on web environment, such as HTML, JSON, XML. Those are the ones that excel spreadsheet cannot easily deal with. We can follow the download link in <a href="http://openrefine.org/download.html" target="_blank">this page</a> to get OpenRefine. Once we have it installed, click the icon and our browser will open automatically showing the OpenRefine workspace.</p>
                
            <h2 id="secondheading">Example</h2>
			
			<p>This example is about maintaining a table of all open portals (most of them being open government portals) supported by Socrata, the number of resources each portal hosts, and the regional government or organization each portal represents. The data used in this example can be retrieved from Socarata API in JSON format using <a href="http://api.us.socrata.com/api/catalog/v1/domains">http://api.us.socrata.com/api/catalog/v1/domains</a>. We will use OpenRefine to transform it into a nice tabular format.

			<p>Please refer to our previous tutorial on “Introduction to API for Open Government Data” for more details on data retrieval.
			
			<h3 id="exampleheadone">Step 1: Create project</h3>
			
			<p>In your browser, choose create project from “Web Addresses (URLs)” and paste the API call <a href="http://api.us.socrata.com/api/catalog/v1/domains" target="_blank">http://api.us.socrata.com/api/catalog/v1/domains</a>. This allows OpenRefine to retrieve data directly from API so that we do not need to download the data.
			<p><img src="http://odl.ischool.uw.edu/assets/img/openrefinetutorial-i2.png">
			<p>Check the following boxes: “Parse cell text into numbers, dates” and “Trim leading and trailing whitespace from strings” and click “Create Project”.

			<h3 id="exampleheadone">Step 2: Remove and rename columns</h3>
			
			<p>Now we can see that the JSON format data has been converted into a table. But there are columns from the original data that we do not need, for example, the “resultSetSize” element. We can delete that column by clicking the small triangle at the column name, choose “Edit column” -> “Remove this column”.
			<p><img src="http://odl.ischool.uw.edu/assets/img/openrefinetutorial-i4.png">
			<p>Using “Edit column” -&gt; “Rename this column”, we could clean up column names. In this example, columns are renamed to “data_portals” and “Item_count” from “results_domain” and “result_count”, respectively.

			<h3 id="exampleheadone">Step 3: Check duplicates</h3>
			<p>OpenRefine makes it very easy to check duplicates based on columns. Use “Facet” -&gt; “Customized facets” -&gt; “Duplicates facet”, we could see in the left-hand panel, there is not any duplicate in “data_portals” column.
				
			<h3 id="exampleheadone">Step 4: Add columns and split string</h3>
			<p>Now we want to add another column called “region” to store the names of the government or the organization hosting each portal, for example, NASA and Seattle. We could work from the urls and extract region names from them. For example, we could extract “seattle” from “data.seattle.gov”. The way we could achieve this is by splitting the urls by “.” (resulting in three elements: “data”, “seattle”, “gov”), and take the second element (“seattle”) out. We can use “Add column based on another column” to create a new column “region” based on “data_portals” column. To do that, we use the “General Refine Expression Language (GREL)” to implement splitting. Type in “split(value, ’.’)[1]” in “Expression” box to pull out the second element of the url and assign it to column “region”. For more on GREL, please visit the <a href="https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/GREL-String-Functions" target="_blank">OpenRefine wiki page</a>.

		   <h3 id="exampleheadone">Step 5: Common transforms</h3>
		   <p>After extracting region names out from urls, we may want to format them, for example, transform them into title case. OpenRefine allows for easy transformation by providing a set of functionalities under “Edit cell” -&gt; “Common transforms”. Let us make all region names title case.
