            <h2 id="topheader"> Tutorial: Using OpenRefine to work with metadata in civic data portals</h2>
            <p>
            <b> Authored by: An Yan</b>
            <p>As a data curator, we constantly need to deal with messy data and metadata. <a href="http://openrefine.org" target="_blank">OpenRefine</a> is a popular open-source tool for cleaning and transforming data. This tutorial will show you how to use OpenRefine to clean metadata about Open Civic Portals pulled from <a href="https://socrata.com" target="_blank">Socrata</a>, an Open Government Data (OGD) Portal provider. We will first use <a href="https://socratadiscovery.docs.apiary.io" target="_blank">Discovery API</a> provided by Socrata to get metadata. Then we will learn to use OpenRefine to perform format transformation, duplicates checking, columns splitting, and exploratory analysis.
            <p>To learn more about APIs, go through the <a href="http://odl.ischool.uw.edu/api_tutorial/" target="_blank">API tutorial</a>.     
            <p>
            <h3 id="nextheaderone"> Learning Objectives </h3>
            <p> <ul> 
            <li>Use API to collect data from public data sources such as open government data portals.</li>
            <li>Use OpenRefine to do data cleaning.</li></ul>
            <h3 id="nextheadertwo"> Prerequisites </h3>
            <p> <ul> 
            <li>Computer and internet access.
            <li>Basic knowledge of any programming language would be helpful, but not required.</li>
            <li>Basic understanding of open data and data repositories; knowledge of popular open data portal software providers (<a href="https://ckan.org" target="_blank">CKAN</a>, <a href="https://socrata.com" target="_blank">Socrata</a>, <a href="https://dataverse.org" target="_blank">Dataverse</a>, etc.)</li>
            <li>Familiarity with common web exchange file formats, such as JSON, XML, and CSV.</li></ul>

            
            <h2 id="myHeader">Introduction to API</h2>
            <p>API stands for Application Programming Interface. An API defines how different applications or different components of software talk to each other, providing a way for developers to simplify programming. Just as a graphical user interface makes it easier for people to use programs, APIs make it easier for developers to use certain functions or data from another application (or another component of an application) without knowing the implementation details [<a href="https://dev.socrata.com/consumers/getting-started.html" target="_blank">1</a>][<a href="2.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface#Web_APIs" target="_blank">2</a>].</p>
            <p>In this lab, we will focus on web APIs. Some applications such as Facebook, Twitter, and Google Map provide services and data through Web APIs. The API is the part of the application that receives requests and sends responses. For example, if you are an iPhone user and you use Yelp to search for a restaurant, you will see an Apple Map embedded in Yelp showing you the location of the restaurant. Yelp does not provide map services itself, but it uses Apple map’s API to integrate with its own functions. Another example of API usage is the Google or Facebook log-in capability on other platforms. When you sign up for a non-Google, non-Facebook website, they may ask if you want to sign in with a Facebook or Google account. This website is using Facebook or Google API to retrieve your account information. </p>
            <p>The APIs that will be used in this lab adhere to an architectural style called REST (Representational State Transfer). “REST services tend to offer an easy-to-parse URL structure consisting of nouns that reflect the logical hierarchical categories of the data on offer” (Maddox, 2014). An example of a REST API web URL is: <a href="http://api.us.socrata.com/api/catalog/v1/domains" target="_blank">http://api.us.socrata.com/api/catalog/v1/domains</a>. When using a REST API, you will need to know how to structure your query. The rules for doing so can usually be found in the API documentation of a web application.</p>
            <p>Why should we learn about API? Software developers use APIs to create well-structured applications. Data scientists and data curators use APIs to collect large amounts of data automatically. Learning to access data and metadata using an API is the main objective of this lab.</p>
